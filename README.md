# 3-tier-app-aws-terraform
Simple 3-tier app example deployed to AWS using Terraform.

# Requirements
- Terraform >= `0.11.12`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` can be put in variables.tf or treated as environment variables to be exported.
- Create EC2 key pair and import the public key to AWS. The key pair is used to control login access to EC2 instances. <br />
Currently Terroform `aws_key_pair` resource requires an existing user-supplied key pair. This key pair's public key will be registered with AWS to allow logging-in to EC2 instances. <br />
When importing an existing key pair the public key material may be in any format supported by AWS. Supported formats (per the AWS documentation) are: <br />
    * OpenSSH public key format (the format in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
    * Base64 encoded DER format
    * SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716

# Useful Info
- CoreOS version = 2023.5.0

```

Terraform plan:
```
~/HanZ-terraform/terraform plan
```

Terraform apply:
```
~/HanZ-terraform/terraform apply
```

After the process is completed, EC2 Instance IP will be showing on the CMD.
